This is a/*n incomplete*/ raytracer implemeted using OpenGL.
Currently there are two modules, one of which takes as input an object file and displays it using the OpenGL routines. The other module displays the output of the raytrace. The shading has not been accounted for yet. Also the geometry is hardcoded as of now. 

Press 'r' to switch between the object and Raytrace mode.

In the raytrace mode, 'w','a','s','d' can be used to move the eye position.
